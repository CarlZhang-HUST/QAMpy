    Create a signal object from matlab file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : basestring
        Matlab filename
    M : int
        QAM order
    keys: list
        Nested list of keys (array names) in the matlab file. Depending on how the data is structured the keys can be in
        one of the following formats:
            If the symbols are given as a multi-dimensional array of complex numbers:
                                                        [[ keyname ]]
            If the symbols are given as multi-dimensional real arrays pairs for real and imaginary part:
                                                        [[ key_real, key_imag ]]
            If the different symbols of modes are saved in different complex arrays:
                                                        [[key_mode1], ..., [key_modeN]]
            If the symbols are given as pairs of real arrays for each mode:
                                                        [[key_mode1_real, key_mode1_imag], ... [key_modeN_real, key_modeN_imag]]
    fb: float, optional
        Symbol rate
    transpose: boolean, optional
        Whether to transpose the matlab arrays
    fake_polmux: boolean, optional
        Whether the signal uses fake polmux, thus the single dimension matlab symbol array should be duplicated
    fake_pm_delay: int, optional
        Number of symbols to delay the second dimension in the fake pol-mux
    normalise : boolean, optional
        Normalise the symbols to an average power of 1 or not. Note that if you do not normalise you need to be very
        careful with your signal metrix

    Returns
    -------

        Whether one of the dimensions is of the matlab arrays indicates real and imaginary parts.
        This is common for data from a realtime oscilloscope
    portmap: list, optional
        The mapping of dimension to mode and real and imaginary (or quadrature and in-phase) parts.
        only used when dim2cmplx is True.

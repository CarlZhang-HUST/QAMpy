    """
    Find the frequency offset by searching in the spectrum of the signal
    raised to 4. Doing so eliminates the modulation for QPSK but the method also
    works for higher order M-QAM.

    Parameters
    ----------
        sig : SignalObject
            signal array with N modes
        average_over_modes : bool
            Using the field in all modes for estimation
        fft_size: array
            Size of FFT used to estimate. Should be power of 2, otherwise the
            next higher power of 2 will be used.

    Returns
    -------
        freq_offset : int
            found frequency offset

        freq_offset: array_like
            frequency offset to compensate for if 1D apply to all modes

    Apply an analog filter to a signal for simulating e.g. electrical bandwidth limitation

    Parameters
    ----------

    signal  : SignalObject
        input signal
    cutoff  : float
        3 dB cutoff frequency of the filter
    ftype   : string, optional
        filter type can be either a bessel, butter, exp or gauss filter (default=bessel)
    order   : int
        order of the filter

    Returns
    -------
    signalout : SignalObject
        filtered output signal

    Low-pass pre-filter signal with square shape filter

    Parameters
    ----------

    signal : SignalObject
        single polarization signal

    bw     : float
        bandwidth of the rejected part, given as fraction of overall length

    Parameters
    ----------
    sig    : SignalObject
        input time distribution of the signal
    beta  : float
        filter roll-off factor needs to be in range [0, 1]
    T     : float, optional
        width of the filter (default: None, use the inverse of the signals symbol rate)
